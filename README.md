# Naive-Base-Classifier

Machine Learning Project - Naive-Base-Classifier 

The project contains a user interface built using the tkinter library, which aims to give the user a convenient and simple interface to run a naive base model based on a separate trian and test set.
The interface allows you to select the folder in which the test and train files are located 
and it will also ask the user for the amount of bins in the Discretization process of continuous variables
, as part of the pre-proceesing in the model.
the project implements a naive base model from scratch.
The model will then print a txt file of the prediction results .
